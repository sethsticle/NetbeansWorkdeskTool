# 🧑‍🏫 WorkDesk Tool: The IT Teacher's Companion

A simple, feature-rich Java application built for educators to manage class logistics, student data, and daily tasks. This tool was originally created as a **real-world demonstration project** while teaching High School Information Technology, showcasing the power of a standard IDE, Java, and database integration.

## 🌟 Features

While the visual design leans towards a classic Java GUI aesthetic, the tool provides robust backend functionality essential for teachers:

| Feature | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timetable Uploader** | Easily upload and store your daily/weekly timetable image for quick, accessible reference. | ✅ Complete |
| **Class List Manager** | Create and manage detailed lists for both **registration/homeroom classes** and **academic subject classes** year-by-year, essential for learning names and grading. | ✅ Complete |
| **To-Do List & Notes** | Simple note-taking and task management. Notes include the creation date, can be marked as complete, and are hidden by default for a clean workspace. | ✅ Complete |
| **Grading/Marks System** | *Not fully implemented.* The foundation is set for managing and grading learner marks. | 🚧 In Progress |

## 💻 Tech Stack & Evolution

This project serves as a practical example of database connectivity in a standard Java application.

  * **Front End/Logic:** **Java** using a standard IDE (originally NetBeans).
  * **Database Initial Stack:** **JDBC** (Java Database Connectivity) for connecting to an **SQL** database using the **UCanAccess** driver.
  * **Database Current Stack:** **SQLite**. The migration to SQLite was made to simplify the project stack, reducing external dependencies and focusing only on what is necessary for a lightweight, portable tool.

## 🗺️ Project Background

> "I made this tool while teaching Information Technology at high school. This was my simple demonstration of what can be achieved with a simple IDE and Java... and some SQL magic of course."

The primary goal of this project was to provide learners with a **tangible, functional example** of how a complete application is built from the ground up, linking user interfaces with persistent data storage.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This section will be updated once the project is fully packaged for release.

### Prerequisites

  * Java Development Kit (JDK) \[version]
  * [Any necessary database files]

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [Your Repo URL]

# Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., NetBeans, IntelliJ, Eclipse)
```

## 🔮 Future Development

Due to the pace of required curriculum progress, this project was paused. Future plans include:

  * Finalizing the **Grading/Marks management** module.
  * Refining the **user interface** for a more modern experience.
  * Packaging the application into a standalone executable (`.jar` or similar) for easier distribution.
